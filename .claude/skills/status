# Claude Code Skill: Project Status Analyzer
# Analyzes markdown files for TODOs and validates against codebase

cat << 'PROMPT'
Please analyze the project status by doing the following:

1. **Scan all markdown documentation files** (especially in .claude/ directory and ROADMAP.md):
   - Look for checkbox items [ ] and [x]
   - Identify TODO items, implementation steps, and features
   - Note which items are marked complete vs incomplete

2. **Categorize by status**:
   - ✅ COMPLETED: Items marked [x] or explicitly stated as complete
   - 🔄 IN PROGRESS: Items marked as in progress or partially complete
   - ⏸️ BLOCKED: Items marked as blocked or dependent on other tasks
   - ❌ NOT STARTED: Items marked [ ] or not yet implemented

3. **Validate against actual codebase**:
   - Check if completed items are actually implemented in the code
   - Identify discrepancies between documentation and reality
   - Look for implemented features not documented
   - Verify file paths and code mentioned in the docs actually exist

4. **Provide a summary report** with:
   - Overall project completion percentage by phase/feature
   - Current phase/focus area
   - Next priority tasks (top 3-5)
   - Any blockers or issues found
   - Discrepancies between docs and codebase

5. **Output format**:
   ```
